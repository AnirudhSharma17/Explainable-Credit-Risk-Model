    "# Validation & Evaluation Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This phase ensures the model is **unbiased, error-free, and production-ready**. We perform comprehensive checks on model performance, fairness, and stability across demographic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Performance Verification** — Ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data  \n",
    "✅ **Bias Detection** — Identify disparities across demographic groups (age, etc.)  \n",
    "✅ **Error Analysis** — Understand failure modes and potential risks  \n",
    "✅ **Stability Assessment** — Bootstrap confidence intervals and feature importance  \n",
    "✅ **Calibration Check** — Verify predicted probabilities are reliable  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What Gets Evaluated?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Performance Metrics (`validation_metrics.py`)\n",
    "- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score** — Overall model quality\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC, PR-AUC** — Discrimination ability across thresholds\n",
    "- **Confusion Matrix** — TP/TN/FP/FN breakdown\n",
    "- **Calibration Curve** — Is predicted probability = actual probability?\n",
    "- **Brier Score, Log Loss** — Probability calibration metrics\n",
    "- **Classification Report** — Per-class precision/recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:** `Model_Results/{ModelName}_metrics_summary.csv`, confusion matrix PNG, ROC/PR/calibration plots\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Age-Related Features & Fairness (`age_features_engineering.py` + `age_fairness_analysis.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Engineering\n",
    "- **age** — Parsed from DOB or birth_year column\n",
    "- **age_norm** — Normalized age (mean=0, std=1)\n",
    "- **age_sq** — Age squared (for nonlinear effects)\n",
    "- **age_bin_fixed** — Human-friendly bins: 0-25, 26-45, 46-65, 66+\n",
    "- **age_bin_q** — Quartile bins (equal frequency)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `Model_Results/age_features.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fairness Analysis by Age Group\n",
    "- **Positive Rate** — % predicted default by age group\n",
    "- **TPR (True Positive Rate)** — Sensitivity: correctly identified defaults\n",
    "- **FPR (False Positive Rate)** — False alarm rate\n",
    "- **Precision & Recall** — Per-age-group performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**  \n",
    "- `Model_Results/fairness_by_age.csv` — Combined fairness metrics all models  \n",
    "- `Model_Results/{ModelName}_fairness_by_age.csv` — Per-model breakdown  \n",
    "- `Model_Results/age_hist.png` — Age distribution  \n",
    "- `Model_Results/age_box_by_target.png` — Age vs target (boxplot)  \n",
    "- `Model_Results/age_posrate_by_agebin.png` — Positive rate by age bin  \n",
    "- `Model_Results/age_stats.csv` — Descriptive statistics (mean, std, min, max, etc.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run\n",
    "### Option: Python Scripts (Standalone)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from explainability.validation_metrics import run_validation\n",
    "from explainability.age_features_engineering import engineer_age_features\n",
    "from explainability.age_fairness_analysis import plot_age_distribution, compute_fairness_by_age\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run validation\n",
    "run_validation(X_eval, y_eval, models, output_dir='Model_Results')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Engineer age features\n",
    "df = engineer_age_features(df, age_col=None, output_dir='Model_Results')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fairness analysis\n",
    "plot_age_distribution(df, output_dir='Model_Results')\n",
    "compute_fairness_by_age(X, y, models, output_dir='Model_Results')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red Flags 🚩\n",
    "- **Large metric gaps by age group** → Potential bias against certain ages  \n",
    "- **High FPR disparity** → Model may false-alarm more for one age group  \n",
    "- **Low calibration** → Predicted probabilities don't match actual rates  \n",
    "- **High variance in bootstrap estimates** → Model may be unstable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Green Flags ✅\n",
    "- **Similar TPR/FPR across age groups** → Fair treatment across demographics  \n",
    "- **Calibration curve close to diagonal** → Reliable probability predictions  \n",
    "- **Tight bootstrap CI (small std)** → Stable predictions  \n",
    "- **High ROC-AUC + balanced metrics** → Good overall performance\n",
    "\n",
